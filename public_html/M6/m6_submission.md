<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <ol>
<li>Create a branch for this assignment called <em>M6-HTML5-Canvas</em></li>
<li>Pick a base HTML5 game from <a href="https://bencentra.com/2017-07-11-basic-html5-canvas-games.html">https://bencentra.com/2017-07-11-basic-html5-canvas-games.html</a></li>
<li>Create a folder inside public_html called  <em>M6</em></li>
<li>Create an html5.html file in your M6 folder (do not put it in Project even if you&#39;re doing arcade)</li>
<li>Copy one of the base games (from the above link)</li>
<li>Add/Commit the baseline of the game you&#39;ll mod for this assignment <em>(Do this before you start any mods/changes)</em></li>
<li>Make two significant changes<ol>
<li>Static changes like hard-coded colors/values will not count at all (i.e., changing shapes/colors/values that are globally defined and set only once.</li>
<li>Direct copies of my class example changes will not be accepted (i.e., just having an AI player for pong, rotating canvas, or multi-ball unless you make a significant tweak to it)</li>
<li>Significant changes are things that change with game logic or modify how the game works. Static changes like hard-coded colors/values will not count at all (i.e., changing shapes/colors/values that are globally defined and set only once). You may however change such values through game logic during runtime. (i.e., when points are scored, boundaries are hit, some action occurs, etc)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Evidence/Screenshots<ol>
<li>As best as you can, gather evidence for your first significant change and fill in the deliverable items below.</li>
<li>As best as you can, gather evidence for your significant change and fill in the deliverable items below.</li>
<li>Remember to include your ucid/date as comments in any screenshots that have code</li>
<li>Ensure your screenshots load and are visible from the md file in step 9</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In the M6 folder create a new file called m6_submission.md</li>
<li>Save your below responses, generate the markdown, and paste the output to this file</li>
<li>Add/commit/push all related files as necessary</li>
<li>Merge your pull request once you&#39;re satisfied with the .md file and the canvas game mods</li>
<li>Create a new pull request from dev to prod and merge it</li>
<li>Locally checkout dev and pull the merged changes from step 12</li>
</ol>
<p>Each missed or failed to follow instruction is eligible for -0.25 from the final grade</p>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I allowed for shooting to be done &quot;grappling hook&quot; style, where only one<br>projectile is shown on screen but can be re-fired as many times as<br>you press the spacebar.

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I allowed for full movement of the player square around the canvas, as<br>opposed to being locked in with up and down movement. I did this<br>by adding left and right arrow keybinds, added to the event listeners for<br>keyup and keydowns, and added the bounds so that the square would stay<br>within the canvas<br></p><br></td></tr>
